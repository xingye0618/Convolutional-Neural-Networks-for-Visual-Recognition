### Goals

In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered architectures.
- Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**.
- Implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks.
- Implement **Batch Normalization** and **Layer Normalization** for training deep networks.
- Implement **Dropout** to regularize networks.
- Understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks** and get practice with training them.
- Gain experience with a major deep learning framework, such as **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.

### Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (20 points)

The notebook `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb` will introduce you to our
modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected
networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several
popular update rules.

### Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points)

In notebook `BatchNormalization.ipynb` you will implement batch normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

### Q3: Dropout (10 points)

The notebook `Dropout.ipynb` will help you implement Dropout and explore its effects on model generalization.

### Q4: Convolutional Networks (30 points)
In the IPython Notebook `ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb` you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

### Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10 (10 points)
For this last part, you will be working in either TensorFlow or PyTorch, two popular and powerful deep learning frameworks. **You only need to complete ONE of these two notebooks.** You do NOT need to do both, and we will _not_ be awarding extra credit to those who do.

Open up either `PyTorch.ipynb` or `TensorFlow.ipynb`. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a  convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.
